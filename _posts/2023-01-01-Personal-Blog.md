I’m a computer engineering student with a fascination for building things for the web. Whether it’s developing innovative web applications or delving into the world of AI research, I’m always eager to learn and create. I have experience working on both the front-end and back-end of web applications, with a strong foundation in programming languages like Python, C, Django, and Next.js. I’m particularly interested in the potential of AI and its impact on various industries. I’m also passionate about sharing knowledge and helping others on their coding journey.
So, if you’re curious about web development, AI, or just want to follow along on my coding adventures, be sure to subscribe to my blog! I’m excited to share my knowledge and insights with you all.
